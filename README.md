PathAdder
=========

Simple tool to add a path to the machine environment PATH variable either with a GUI or from the command line.

Run the program and select the path to append by entering it in the textbox and clicking append (or hitting enter).
Click the textbox to get a file browser. The program defaults to using your clipboard path if it's valid, just press append to add it.

To run the program without a GUI, just use "PathAdder C:/Foo" to specify a path.
The program will not let you add a path that already exists in the environment variable, a path that is invalid, or a path that does not exist.
